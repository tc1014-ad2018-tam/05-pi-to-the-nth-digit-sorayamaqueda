/*
 * This program is to calculate and then display the rational number of Pi with n digits. The value of n will be
 * introduced by the user.
 * We used the += symbol which stands for Sigma, given that the established formula for Pi is a Sigma of continuous
 * differences, which will stop at the given value of n.
 *
 * Problem Analysis.
 * Problem: Write a program that gives the user the number Pi up to the nth digit (as long as she/he wants).
 * Input: Number of digits the user wants to see.
 * Calculations: 16^-i * * ((4.0 / (8*i + 1))-(2.0 / (8*i + 4))-(1.0 / (8*i + 5))-(1.0 / (8*i + 6)))
 * Outputs: Pi. nth digits
 *
 * Algorithm:
 * 1 Begin
 * 2 Ask the user for the number of digits she/he wants
 * 3 Calculate the Sigma of Pi from i=0 to n (+= is the symbol for Sigma).
 * 4 Display Pi with n digits.
 * 5 End
